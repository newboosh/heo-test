# Feedback Intake Template
# Phase 13b: Feedback Synthesis (Scrum Master)
#
# Transforms monitoring signals and retrospective insights into
# actionable intake items for the next sprint. Closes the loop
# from Phase 13 back to Phase 1.
#
# Produced by: skills/feedback-synthesizer/SKILL.md
# Consumed by: Phase 1 (intake) of the next sprint cycle

# --- Handoff envelope (standard for all 13 phases) ---
#
# NOTE: This is Phase 13b (feedback synthesis), a secondary output of
# Phase 13. The validator enforces phase_name "retrospective" and
# depends_on "monitoring" for all phase-13 files. Conceptually this
# artifact is produced *after* the retrospective and depends on it,
# but the one-name-per-phase constraint requires these values.
