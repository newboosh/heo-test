# Execution Status Template
# Phase 6: Implementation (Developer / TDD)
#
# Structured handoff for the implementation phase. Summarizes task
# completion, test counts, and files changed. Complements the detailed
# execution-log.md narrative with machine-readable status.
#
# NOTE: Phase 6 also produces execution-log.md (markdown, no envelope).
# This file is the structured YAML companion used by downstream phases.
